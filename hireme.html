			<h1>Hire Me</h1>

<p>
If you are looking for an engaged, autonomous developer/designer to implement your native <b>iOS or Android</b> project - you found him!
</p>

<h2>What Will You Get?</h2>

<p>
I am able to fulfill all tasks of the typical mobile development and design process:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Wireframing,</li>
	<li>Design,</li>
	<li>Implementation, and</li>
	<li>Deployment.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I am able to do all of these because UI design and photoshopping is one of my hobbies, and I have been scripting and programming for almost 10 years - both at university and commercial projects.
</p>

<p>
In case a project is too short-term or intense for me to finish alone, I know where to find help.
</p>

<p>
In short: <b>You can get the whole app from me, with all its bells and whistles.</b>
</p>

<h2>References</h2>

<p>
I have (also) worked with:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Tailored Apps (Austria),</li>
	<li>Spectralmind (Austria),</li>
	<li>Yourpowr / Carbonguerrilla (United Kingdom),</li>
	<li>Tquila (United Kingdom),</li>
	<li>Moosify (USA / Austria),</li>
	<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>
(Not including numerous unpublished hobby apps :).)
</p>

<h2>Why hire a One Man Show?</h2>

<p>
I like to compare software development to CPU scheduling - as long as a project is doable by one developer (single-core CPU), the project will have <b>less overhead</b> as compared to multi-developer teams (multi-core CPU). Communication overhead, information loss, and worktask deadlocks are nonexistant within a one-developer-team, while it seems to increase exponentially with a growing number of team members (teams with > 8 members are a bad idea in every domain, for this very reason).
</p>
<p>
The reason single-core CPUs are not so common anymore is that their performance can't be scaled up by engaging another core. Do mobile app projects need to scale up? In most cases, <b>No.</b> Mobile apps can often be developed by a single person. The benefits of having a one-developer-team are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Maximal efficiency</b> with zero overhead, </li>
	<li><b>Consistent design</b> (UI and code), and</li>
	<li>The <b>passion</b> of a developer for a product which is all his (and all its consequences!).</li>
</ul>	

<h2>Teamwork</h2>
<p>
As mentioned before, I am aware that certain requirements or circumstances forbid employment of a one-developer-team. <b>I love working in good teams</b> (I like people!), and I am willing to integrate myself into a development process if I deem it fit and productive.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
I am a <b>perfectionist</b>, both design- and code-wise - I focus on what's important for the users' experience, and I don't take the easy way out. I stick with a problem until I find a way to solve it.
</p>
<p>
I'm <b>persistent</b> - I stick with a problem until it is solved, using all of the tools available to me to achieve what I want done.
</p>
<p>
The currently <b>most important feature</b> is what's on top of my todo list. Sounds obvious, but it takes constant reflection what the most important feature really is. This saves everybody a lot of YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It), and therefore time and effort.
</p>
<p>
I like <b>clean, consistent code</b>, and I hit Stackoverflow multiple times a day to find ways to keep it clean even in difficult situations. Broken windows are what starts the decay of an abandonded urban building, and code smells are what starts the decay of an application's code structure. Therefore I fix issues the very moment I find them.
</p>
<p>
I am used to producing <b>weekly releases</b>, putting them up as beta versions (e.g. on TestFlightApp), enabling clients to test the app while it matures. I think it's obvious that my methods are inspired by <b>agile</b> development processes.
</p>
<p>
I am able to free myself from aforementioned methods of structured thinking when designing - <b>creativity</b> cannot thrive on structure, but rather on play and experimentation.
